# PowerBillCalculator
Simple Avalonia app that calculates a power bill. Calculations are based on kWh cost and taxes that get added to the final bill.

Can be compiled for desktop and Android.

## Settings and first use
Both values used for calculation are customizable and saved locally. They default to zero, so on first use it's necessary to set them.

The settings page is accessible through the bottom right button.

## Currency format
Currency is displayed based on device region settings, e.g. on a US device the dollar format is used.
